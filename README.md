# Emotion_Classifier
Emotion Classifier is NLP based project to understand and classify emotions . NLP techniques are used to preprocess the text data, tokenize the text, and convert it into a format suitable for input into the CNN model. The application is built using Streamlit and leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for emotion classification.
